# Gustavo Murillo
**Research Engineer | Distributed Systems & Immersive Architectures**  
*M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering | Specialist in Immersive Collaboration & Computer Vision*

I specialize in the design and implementation of **decentralized architectures** where heterogeneous devices (VR, Mobile AR, and Embedded Systems) interact in real-time. My work bridges the gap between high-level software algorithms and physical hardware integration.

### 🔬 Technical Expertise
My focus is on creating robust, scalable systems that maintain consistency and performance across distributed environments.

* **Computer Vision & Signal Processing:** Implementation of Digital Image Processing (PDI) and Signal Processing (DSP) for object pose estimation, sensor fusion, and real-time data acquisition.
* **Immersive Systems & XR:** Architecture of collaborative environments using Unity (C#), ARCore, and WebXR.
* **Distributed Systems:** Design of decentralized models for multi-user interaction, optimizing data transmission and latency.
* **Hardware-Software Integration:** Rapid prototyping through custom PCB design, 3D modeling (Blender/Fusion 360), and manufacturing for experimental setups.
